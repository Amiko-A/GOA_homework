    <p>The BRABUS brand has been building high-performance supercars based on Mercedes-Benz automobiles for more than four decades. This tradition now continues logically and seamlessly under the BRABUS MASTERPIECE label with the new BRABUS ROCKET 900 "ONE OF TEN." A limited edition of just ten vehicles of this model will be built in the high-end BRABUS Manufaktur in Bottrop based on the GT 63 S 4MATIC+.

        At the heart of this BRABUS top-of-the-line automobile is the new BRABUS ROCKET 900 Biturbo V8 increased-displacement engine, which thanks to the displacement increase to 4.5 liters and a new high-performance forced- induction system delivers a peak output of 662 kW / 900 hp. 
        In combination with the SPEEDSHIFT MCT 9-speed sports transmission and all-wheel drive, the four-seat coupe slings itself from rest to 100 km/h in just 2.8 seconds. The car reaches 300 km/h in just 23.9 seconds.
        
        Due to the tires, the top speed is electronically limited to 330 km/h. In order to put the tremendous power of the new BRABUS increased-displacement engine onto the road optimally, the BRABUS ROCKET 900 "ONE OF TEN" is equipped with extremely wide Monoblock Z wheels with diameters of 21" on the front and  22" on the rear axle. High-performance tires are supplied by our technology partner Pirelli.To create space for them, the BRABUS designers developed a carbon widebody with thrilling styling. The matching aerodynamic-enhancement components were developed in the wind tunnel. They produce more downforce and thus increase the handling stability at high speeds.</p>
